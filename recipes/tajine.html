    <h1>Moroccan Tagine</h1>

    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>This Moroccan tagine features a family style vegetable combo of carrots, potatoes, and chickpeas. Spicy food lovers will want to add the optional cayenne pepper or serve harissa on the side.</p>
    <p>Moroccans usually prefer dried chickpeas over canned. If using dried, soak about 1 cup of beans overnight, and then cook until tender (60 minutes or longer) in salted water before adding them to the recipe.</p>
    <p>Cooking time is for a pressure cooker. Allow double this time if preparing in a conventional pot, and triple this time if cooking in a clay or ceramic tagine.</p>     
        
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 pounds (500 to 700 grams) beef, lamb or goat meat, cut into 2- or 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped or sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped or pressed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro, plus more as needed for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley, optional, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or 1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads, crumbled, optional</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper, optional, to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound (500 grams) carrots, peeled and quartered lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 pound (500 grams) potatoes, peeled and quartered lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 cups chickpeas, cooked or canned</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red or green olives</li>
        <li>1 preserved lemon, quartered and seeds removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the meat with onion, garlic, cilantro/parsley, spices and olive oil in a pressure cooker. Brown the meat, uncovered, over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of water, cover, and cook the meat with pressure for 25 minutes if using beef, and about 35 minutes if using lamb or goat meat.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, adding water if necessary so that the broth almost reaches the top of the carrots. Cover and cook with pressure for about 7 minutes. Add the potatoes and chickpeas, and cook with pressure until the potatoes are tender about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the preserved lemon and olives, and reduce the sauce until it is thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the tagine to a large serving platter, garnished with freshly chopped parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
