        <h2>Description :</h2>
        <p>Harira is a classic Moroccan comfort soup made with tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, fresh herbs, dried spices, and meat, making it a filling and satisfying dish. Although served year-round, it is particularly popular for breaking the fast during Ramadan. It can be offered as an appetizer or main, depending on the serving size, and is usually served with lemon slices (or lemon juice), crusty bread, figs, and a honey-rosewater flavored pastry called chebakia.
        </p>
        <p>There are many variations on harira, and recipes are often passed down from generation to generation. Some versions feature broken pieces of vermicelli and smen—a preserved butter with a Parmesan-like taste. Harira is typically made with chicken, lamb, or beef, but some variations of this recipe skip the meat to be vegetarian and vegan. Make it gluten free by replacing the vermicelli with rice noodles and skipping the flour.
        </p>
       <p>For this recipe, we use a pressure cooker for a shorter cooking time; to adapt for simmering on the stove, follow the directions for the traditional stockpot method. To make it easier, soak the chickpeas and lentils overnight.
        </p>
       <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 pound lamb, beef, or chicken, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and pureed</li>
            <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery with leaves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight and peeled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smen, optional</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, or 1/4 teaspoon yellow food coloring</li>
            <li>11 cups water, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dried lentils, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste, mixed into 1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons raw rice, or 2 tablespoons broken vermicelli</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>Coarsely chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker on medium-high. Add the meat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring to brown all sides.</li>
            <li>Chunks of meat cooking in a pressure cooker</li>
            <li>Add the pureed tomatoes, onion, celery, chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, salt, ginger, smen, if using, black pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric. Stir and add 3 cups of the water. Cover tightly and heat over high heat until pressure is achieved.</li>
            <li>A pressure cooker with pureed tomatoes, onion, celery, chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, salt, ginger, smen, black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, and water</li>
            <li>Add the lentils, tomato paste mixture, and the remaining 8 cups of water. If at any point there's an oily surface forming on top of the soup, simply skim it off and discard. This can happen because of the meat's fat, if left on.</li>
            <li>Have the rice or vermicelli at hand, if using, but don't add yet.</li>
            <li>A bowl of rice near the Harira stock</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and heat the soup over high heat until pressure is achieved. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking.</li>
            <li>If adding rice, cook the soup on pressure for 30 minutes. Release the pressure and add the rice. Cover and cook with pressure for an additional 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>If using vermicelli, cook the soup on pressure for 45 minutes. Release the pressure, and add the vermicelli. Simmer the soup, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes or until the vermicelli is plump and cooked. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>While the soup is cooking, make a soup thickener by mixing together the flour and water. Mix well, but if the mixture is not smooth, pass it through a sieve to remove lumps.</li>
            <li>A bowl of smooth water and flour mixture</li>
            <li>Bring the soup to a full simmer. Slowly, and in a thin stream, pour in 1/4 of the flour mixture. Stir constantly and keep the soup simmering so the flour doesn’t stick to the bottom or cooks up in lumps.</li>
            <li>Adding the soup thickener to the pressure cooker</li>
            <li>Add another 1/4 of the flour thickener. You will notice the soup beginning to thicken when you've used approximately half the flour mixture. The thickness of harira is up to you.</li>
            <li>A spoon checking the thickness of the soup</li>
            <li>Simmer the thickened soup, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 10 minutes to cook off the taste of the flour. Remove the soup from the heat, serve, and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
        </ol>
